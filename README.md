# Kris Chamberlin's Portfilio

Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a junior web developer looking for Front-End programming work, particularly using ReactJS. Although I have limited experience, I am driven, passionate, and hungry to grow my skillset and prove myself.

Ideally, I would like to join an environment with mentorship, peer review, and/or paired programming.

### `Skills`
My focus is on Front-End technologies, with an emphasis on React.  My exposure to the Back-End stems from a coding boot camp, but I am currently in the process of teaching myself more thoroughly. 

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- MySQL
