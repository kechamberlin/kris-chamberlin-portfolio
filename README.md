# Kris Chamberlin's Portfilio

Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a junior web developer looking for Front-End programming work, particularly using ReactJS. Although I have limited experience, I am driven, passionate, and hungry to grow my skillset and prove myself.

Ideally, I would like to join an environment with mentorship, peer review, and/or paired programming.
